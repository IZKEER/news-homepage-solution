## Overview
Very basic news landing page made with HTML & SCSS.
This is my first practice project using SCSS after learning some theorical concepts.
### The challenge
Found challenging finding a way to make a scss function to work with 
col-1-(to)-12 (implementing the class into the html instead of declaring a new col with width throughout the Scss files.)

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for desktop (mobile responsiveness not ready yet.)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- SCSS/SASS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

its always nice to recap some basic stuff like flexbox properties, how to center a DIV ðŸ˜… and so on !
I've been reading about Sass and BEM methodology so i used this practice project to put it to practice for the first time.
```scss
//function to call col-1 col-2 up to 12, into html file class.
@for $i from 1 through 12 {
    .col-#{$i} {
        width: calc($i * 100% / 12);
    }
}
